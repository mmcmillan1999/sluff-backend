/**
 * Sluff: Project Roadmap & Feature Plan
 * =======================================
 *
 * --- PHASE 1: Workable Local Prototype ---
 * Goal: Establish the fundamental game logic and rules in a local, non-networked environment.
 *
 * - [x] Core Rule Implementation: Code the basic logic for card dealing, bidding, trick-taking, and scoring.
 * - [x] State Management: Create a system to manage the state of a single game instance.
 *
 *
 * --- PHASE 2: Functional Web-Based Playable Game ---
 * Goal: Transition the local prototype to a multiplayer web application with a basic user interface.
 *
 * - [x] Client/Server Architecture: Set up the initial React frontend and Node.js backend with WebSocket communication.
 * - [x] Multiplayer Lobby: Implement a basic lobby system to allow multiple players to join a game table.
 * - [x] User Authentication: Add persistent user accounts with registration and login.
 * - [x] Transaction Ledger: Implement a robust, transaction-based system for managing player tokens.
 *
 *
 * --- PHASE 3: Alpha Testing with Real Users ---
 * Goal: Address critical bugs, complete core logic, and deliver key features for family tournament play.
 *
 * High-Priority Bug Fixes & Logic Completion:
 * - [ ] Table Reset Logic: Fix the bug preventing a table from correctly resetting to a "waiting for players" state after a round concludes.
 * - [ ] Forfeit & Disconnect Logic:
 * - [ ] Implement the three possible outcomes for a mutual draw request.
 * - [ ] Finalize the logic for proportional token distribution when a player forfeits or is disconnected.
 * - [ ] Add a turn timer to prompt inactive (AFK) players, eventually leading to a forfeit if no action is taken.
 * - [ ] "Dumb" AI Implementation:
 * - [ ] Create a baseline AI player that can join a game and make *legal* moves.
 * - [ ] The AI's strategy will be simple: if it can follow suit, it plays a random legal card; if it cannot, it plays a random trump or off-suit card.
 *
 * User Account & Security:
 * - [ ] Account Recovery: Implement a "Forgot Password" system via email.
 * - [ ] Email Confirmation: Require new users to confirm their email address upon registration.
 *
 * Quality of Life & UI Enhancements:
 * - [ ] Enhanced Card Play Experience: Overhaul the card playing mechanic to allow players to drag and drop their selected card onto the play area.
 * - [ ] Visible Widow & Trump Puck:
 * - [ ] Display the face-down Widow pile on the game table.
 * - [ ] Add a visual indicator (a "puck") to the table once the trump suit has been broken.
 * - [ ] Expanded Sound Effects: Add sound effects for key actions: card played, trump played, card sluffed, trick won, and a celebration sound for winning a round.
 *
 * Tooling & Support:
 * - [ ] In-App Feedback Tool: Implement a simple "Send Feedback" button that allows testers to easily report bugs and suggestions.
 *
 *
 * --- PHASE 4: Beta - Polish & Player Engagement ---
 * Goal: Transform the game from a functional app into a polished, engaging experience ready for a public beta test.
 *
 * Visual & Sensory Polish:
 * - [ ] Card Art & Animation:
 * - [ ] Commission or create unique, high-quality art for the card faces and backs.
 * - [ ] Implement a smooth card dealing animation at the start of each round.
 * - [ ] Add a "flipping" animation when a card is played to the table.
 * - [ ] Mobile-First UI Overhaul: Conduct a thorough review and redesign of all UI components to ensure a seamless and intuitive experience on mobile phones.
 *
 * Feature Development:
 * - [ ] New Player Onboarding:
 * - [ ] Create "Free Play" tables where tokens are not required.
 * - [ ] Implement an in-game "Cheat Sheet" window showing points captured, cards played, and basic rule reminders.
 * - [ ] Community & Chat:
 * - [ ] Add a persistent chat window to the main lobby.
 * - [ ] Implement in-game "chat bubbles" that appear above a player's seat briefly and then fade away.
 * - [ ] Tournament Mode (v1):
 * - [ ] Develop a system for creating and managing multi-round tournaments.
 * - [ ] Includes a tournament bracket view and automated player progression.
 * - [ ] Private Rooms: Allow players to create password-protected tables to play exclusively with friends.
 * - [ ] Advanced Player Statistics: Create a dedicated profile screen where players can view detailed statistics, including win/loss ratio, favorite bid, performance by suit, trick-taking percentage, and more.
 *
 *
 * --- PHASE 5: Live Game - Monetization & Long-Term Growth ---
 * Goal: Implement features to support a live, revenue-generating game and foster a long-term player community.
 *
 * Monetization & Economy:
 * - [ ] Rewarded Ads: Replace the "Mercy Token" system with a standard rewarded video ad that grants players tokens for watching.
 * - [ ] Cosmetic In-App Purchases:
 * - [ ] Sell unique card back designs.
 * - [ ] Sell custom table themes and environments (e.g., "The Ranch," "Grampa George," "Dan's Deck").
 * - [ ] Battle Pass / Seasonal System: Introduce a seasonal "pass" that allows players to unlock exclusive cosmetic rewards by playing and completing challenges.
 *
 * Community & Competition:
 * - [ ] Seasonal Leaderboards: Implement weekly and monthly leaderboards with rewards for top players to drive competition.
 * - [ ] Smart AI (Machine Learning): Begin collecting game data to train a more advanced AI that can provide a genuine challenge for experienced players in single-player modes.
 * - [ ] Interactive Tutorial: Create a guided, playable tutorial that walks new users through a full round of Sluff, explaining the rules and strategies as they go.
